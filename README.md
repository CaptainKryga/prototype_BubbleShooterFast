## There is a basic interface:
* Main menu.
* Pause and end game menu.
* Game interface (pause button).

## Level types:
* Randomly generated.
* Pre-created.

## Mechanics:
* We can shoot a ball of a certain color in the direction specified by the player.
* Destruction of balls of the same color when hit by them.
* Bounce of the ball from the walls and ceiling.
* If the ball does not hit any ball of its color, it sticks to the rest of the balls.
* Supports mouse and stick control.
* In random mode, it is possible to score points.
* The sequence of colors of the balls that the player shoots depends on the level, if the level is pre-generated, then a certain chain of colors is given, which repeats endlessly. If the level is random, then the chain is random.
