## Level types:
* `Randomly generated.`
* `Pre-created.`

## Mechanics:
* `We can shoot a ball of a certain color in the direction specified by the player.`
* `Destruction of balls of the same color when hit by them.`
* `Bounce of the ball from the walls and ceiling.`
* `If the ball does not hit any ball of its color, it sticks to the rest of the balls.`
* `Supports mouse and stick control.`
* `In random mode, it is possible to score points.`
* `The sequence of colors of the balls that the player shoots depends on the level, if the level is pre-generated, then a certain chain of colors is given, which repeats endlessly. If the level is random, then the chain is random.`
